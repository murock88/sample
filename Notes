The distinction between the two types of 
embedded Ruby is that <% ... %> executes the code 
inside, while <%= ... %> executes it and inserts the 
result into the template.) 


The main difference between classes and ids is that classes can be used multiple times on a page, but ids can be used only once.

On the server, Rails associates images in the assets directory with the proper app/assets/images directory, 
but as far as the browser is concerned all the assets look like they are in the same directory, 
which allows them to be served faster.

Although rails generate automatically creates a separate CSS file for each controller, 
it’s surprisingly hard to include 
them all properly and in the right order, so for simplicity we’ll put all of the 
CSS needed for this tutorial in a single file.

In other words, the dot . in .center indicates that the rule styles a class. 
(As we’ll see in Listing 5.7, the pound sign # identifies a rule to style a CSS id.)

*= require_tree .
ensures that all CSS files in the app/assets/stylesheets directory 
(including the tree subdirectories) are included into the application CSS. The line
*= require_self
specifies where in the loading sequence the CSS in application.css itself gets included.
